# Contribution Guidelines

**To add to the list:** Submit a pull request

**To remove from the list:** Open an issue

When editing the list:

- List items should be sorted alphabetically
- Each item should be limited to one link
- Descriptions should follow the link, on the same line
- Descriptions should be clear, concise, and non-promotional
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome

Please contribute links to libraries/projects/resources you have used or are familiar with. This will help ensure high-quality entries.


## Quality standard

To stay on the list, libraries/projects/resources should adhere to these quality standards:

- Generally useful to the community
- Documented so that a person unfamiliar with the project can get it working
- Actively maintained (even if that just means acknowledging open issues when they arise)
- Stable or progressing toward stable


## Reporting issues

Please email or send a Slack message to Konrad Rokicki if you find anything that could be improved or have suggestions for making the list a more valuable resource.
